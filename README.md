M-Pox detection using deep learning models and eXplainable AI

The rapid escalation of the Monkeypox Virus (MPV) has raised concerns about its potential to 
become a global pandemic, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, to have appropriate protocols and countermeasures
in place, to prevent another international outbreak is of paramount importance. Since Deep 
learning techniques have shown promising results in detecting and predicting COVID-19 cases, 
expecting to show similar results with Monkeypox diagnosis. This study investigates the use of 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to diagnose monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging 
Transfer Learning to overcome data scarcity. The performance of the developed models was evaluated using four metrics. Our results 
consistently showed that DenseNet121 outperformed the other models in terms of all metrics 
when pre-trained with ImageNet dataset showed 88.9% accuracy and with HAM10000 dataset showed 75.9% accuracy on test data. While different studies may 
have outperformed others in specific evaluation metrics, our modified DenseNet201 exhibited 
superior performance in terms of recall and F1-Score for both source datasets.
Additionally, the application of explainable AI 
techniques, such as LRP, will be explored to be able to explain the model's predictions.
Explainable AI (XAI) plays a significant role in healthcare by improving the transparency, 
interpretability, and trustworthiness of AI models, leading to better decision-making and patient 
diagnosis.
